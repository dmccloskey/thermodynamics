formation energies for dnxps and nxps other than amp, adp, and atp from reactant contribution method are bad
use formation enerigeis from group contribution method instead

current concentration coverage = 93
previous concentration coverage = 76

add method to remove data from simulation_data,
	thermodynamics_dG_f_data
	metabolomics_data, thermodynamics_dG_r_data

make a method to concisely summarize the consistency check

make a method to calculate the dG_r for an arbitrary pathway
	e.g. calculate_dG_pathway(cobra_model, reaction_list, reaction_stoich)
